## Abstract

[A few sentences saying that we did it, and how.]

## Submission checklist

This section describes how each of the required checklist items have been met
for project submission.

[CW: by having a sentence or two for each of these, we should make it really
easy for the Udacity assessor to see we've done everything we are supposed to.]

**Launch correctly using the launch files provided in the capstone repo**

**Smoothly follow waypoints in the simulator**

**Respect the target top speed set for the waypoints**

**Stop at traffic lights when needed**

**Stop and restart PID controllers depending on the state of /vehicle/dbw_enabled**

**Publish throttle, steering, and brake commands at 50 Hz**

**Test it out using ROS bags that were recorded at the test site**


## Required set-up

[CW: notes on any one-time scripts to run, etc]

## Waypoint processing

## Drive-by-wire controls

### Steering

### Braking and acceleration

## Training image capture

### Simulation images

[CW: will write something here about automatic capture of classified simulation images]

### Real images

## Image classifier and results: Faster R-CNN

## Image classifier and results: VGG

[CW: will write something here about my adventures with VGG, and include video]

## Other sections I've forgotten about

## Summary

[CW: We did it. Again. ?]
