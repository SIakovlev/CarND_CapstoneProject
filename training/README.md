Just started by copying my code from semantic segregation project
(https://github.com/charlie-wartnaby/udacity/tree/master/self-driving-car/CarND-Semantic-Segmentation)
to use as a basis -- will steal ideas from there on loading image batches and formatting as numpy
arrays and so-on. Created Visual Studio project so that I can debug easily on Windows PC (with GPU).
Using carnd-advdl-odlab Conda environment from term 3 object detection lab.
